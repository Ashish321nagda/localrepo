📖 Problem Statement

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Provisioning for Agriculture System
This project focuses on automating the provisioning of infrastructure for an Agriculture System using Infrastructure as Code principles. The system enables automated deployment of local Docker environments and cloud infrastructure (such as Amazon Web Services), along with automatic installation of required dependencies.
This approach reduces manual configuration, minimizes human errors, and enables repeatable and scalable infrastructure setup.

Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment for an Agriculture System environment.
